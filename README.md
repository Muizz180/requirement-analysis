Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of Requirement Analysis in software development. It is designed to help developers, project managers, and stakeholders understand the purpose, processes, and importance of capturing and analyzing requirements effectively in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and requirements of stakeholders for a software system. It is a crucial phase in the SDLC that ensures the final product meets user expectations and business objectives.

It involves gathering input from clients, end users, and other stakeholders, analyzing those needs, and translating them into detailed specifications for developers to follow. This step helps avoid misunderstandings and costly changes later in the development process.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is vital in the SDLC for the following reasons:

1. Ensures Clarity and Understanding: It helps all stakeholders gain a clear understanding of the project goals and deliverables.


2. Reduces Development Costs and Time: Accurate requirements prevent scope creep and rework, saving both time and money.


3. Improves Product Quality: Well-defined requirements lead to better design decisions and ultimately a more successful final product.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Gathering: Collecting requirements from stakeholders via interviews, surveys, or documents.

Requirement Elicitation: Discovering hidden or implicit needs through observation and interaction.

Requirement Documentation: Writing down all gathered requirements in a structured format.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Evaluating, prioritizing, and representing requirements using models or diagrams.

Requirement Validation: Ensuring the documented requirements are complete, consistent, and achievable.

Types of Requirements

Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the actions that the system should perform. For the booking management project, examples include:

Users can search for available properties.

Hosts can list new properties.

Guests can book a property.

The system should process payments.


Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define the systemâ€™s qualities or constraints. Examples for the booking system include:

The system must handle up to 10,000 users concurrently.

Payment processing must be completed within 3 seconds.

The site should be available 99.9% of the time.

Data must be encrypted during transactions.

Use Case Diagrams

Use case diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system.

What are Use Case Diagrams?

Use Case Diagrams help identify how users interact with the system and what functionalities are expected. They are beneficial for both developers and stakeholders to align understanding.

Use Case Diagram Example:

Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define the specific conditions that a product or feature must meet to be accepted by the user or stakeholder.

Importance of Acceptance Criteria

Provides a clear definition of "done"

Helps developers know what to build

Aids testers in validating the feature


Example: Checkout Feature Acceptance Criteria

User must be logged in to initiate checkout.

Checkout page must display booking details and total cost.

User must provide valid payment information.

System should confirm booking and show a success message.
